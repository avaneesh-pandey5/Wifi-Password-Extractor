# Wifi-Password-Extractor
This program will send the WiFi and their Passwords of the PC it is ran on, from sender's mail (sm) to Reciever's mail (rm) 

First change the Sender's Mail (sm) and Password (pswd) and make sure the email you are using to send mail has "Less Secure Apps" turned ON, otherwise it won't log in.
The reciever's mail will recieve all the WIfi Name and Passwords List (make sure to check the spam folder)
